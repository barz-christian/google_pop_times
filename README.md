# google_pop_times 

For a non-profit application I created during a weekend a POC how to use Google Places Web Service API and [populartimes](https://github.com/m-wrzr/populartimes) to get the popularity of places.

And what could that be good for?

For example we want to collect donations for the [victims the flood in germany](https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/hochwasserkatastrophe-101.html). Hence we are looking for high freuquent places.

A simple example how to use the data can be seen here: https://christianbarz.shinyapps.io/pop_times/ (text in german, start may take 1 min)


I may going to clean up the messy code soon, because at [Baumentscheid-Berlin](https://www.baumentscheid.de/) we have good use for this old POC.
