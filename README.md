# google_pop_times

This was an short project on how use the  Google Places Web Service API to get the popularity of places.

And what could that be good for?

For example we want to collect donations for the [victims the flood in germany](https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/hochwasserkatastrophe-101.html). Hence 
we are looking for high freuquent places.

A simple example how to use the data can be seen here: https://christianbarz.shinyapps.io/pop_times/ (text in german, start may take 1 min)
